TABLE(DATASET) - substation_details
substation_acronym - acronym(short form) used to represent the substation name
substation name - name of the substation
voltage - various voltage levels present at the substation. the more voltage levels, the bigger the substation
voltage levels - count of the voltage levels
installed capacity - installed transformer capacity 
capacity band - created bins to group installed capacities of transformers. Useful when ranking events
location - region where the substation is located. substations in the central region are generally bigger, more loaded and more important
region_code - Codes assigned depending on importance of the region.central region - Most important. 
    produces more than 90% of the country's GDP.thats where most of the load is
    eastern - has the biggest dams, the second most industrialized city in the country (Jinja), 
    Country's largest single power consumer (Tororo cement), facilitates regional power trade with Kenya
    western region - Second most important in terms of economic productivity
    RANKINS. {"central":5,"eastern":4,"western":3,else, 1} 
generators - indicates whether the substation has generators (dams) connected to it. 1-YES, 0-NO
critical level - shows how important substation is to the national grid. 1 - NOT VERY IMPORTANT, 5- VERY IMPORTANT
comments - brief description of why substation is assigned a given critical level

TABLE(DATASET) - final_data
datetime - original datetime object from the SCADA system
event - event as described in the SCADA system
date - date extracted from original datetime object
month - month extracted from original datetime object
weekday - weekday extracted from original datetime object
type - identifies whether an event is critical or normal
substation_acronym - acronym(short form) used to represent the substation name
substation name - name of the substation
fault_voltage - voltage level at which faulty equipment operates
critical level - shows how important substation is to the national grid. 1 - NOT VERY IMPORTANT, 5- VERY IMPORTANT
fault_level_code - ranks event criticallity based on the voltage levels. DC and station supply faults are given
more priority beacuse substation protection and control IEDs, alarms and fire systems need to be powered 24/7
Rank - ranks the events in order of criticallity. events with the highest rank are attended to first
